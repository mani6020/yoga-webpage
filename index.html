        <h1><b>YOGA</b></h1>
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p> What is often referred to as classical yoga, ashtanga yoga, or rāja yoga is primarily the yoga outlined in the dualistic Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.The origins of classical yoga are unclear, although early discussions of the term appear in the Upanishads.Rāja yoga (yoga of kings) originally denoted the ultimate goal of yoga; samadhi, but was popularised by Vivekananda as a common name for ashtanga yoga, the eight limbs attain samadhi as described in the Yoga Sutras.Yoga philosophy came to be regarded as a distinct orthodox school (darsanas) of Hinduism in the second half of the first millennium CE.

            Classical yoga incorporates epistemology, metaphysics, ethical practices, systematic exercises and self-development for body, mind and spirit.Its epistemology (pramana) and metaphysics are similar to the Sāṅkhya school. The Classical yoga's metaphysics, like Sāṅkhya's, primarily posits two distinct realities: prakriti (nature, the eternal and active unconscious source of the material world composed of three Gunas) and puruṣa (consciousness), the plural consciousnesses which are the intelligent principles of the world.Moksha (liberation) results from the isolation (kaivalya) of puruṣa from prakirti, and is achieved through meditation, stilling one's thought waves (citta vritti) and resting in pure awareness of puruṣa.Unlike Sāṅkhya, which takes a non-theistic approach,the yoga school of Hinduism accepts a "personal, yet essentially inactive, deity" or "personal god" (Ishvara).The sample yoga asanasare:</p><br>
    <p>1.Trikonasana (Triangle Pose): Stand straight on your yoga mat and separate your feet comfortable wide apart. Then turn your right foot 90 degrees and left foot by 15 degrees. Align the center of your right heel with the center of your arch of the left foot. Make sure your feet are pressing the ground and the weight of your body is equally balanced on your feet. Inhale deeply and as you exhale, bend your body to the right, downward from the hips without hampering your feet movement. Keep the waist straight, allowing your left hand to come up in the air, whilst your right hand comes down to the floor. Ensure your hands are in straight line. Come back in the same position and repeat it again on the left side.</p>

    <p>2.Navasana (Boat Pose): To attain this pose, sit on the floor with the legs extended in front of you. Press your hands on the floor, slightly behind your hips, fingers should be pointing towards the feet and strengthen the arms. Lift through the top of the sternum and lean back a little. Ensure your back is straight and continue to lengthen the front of your torso. Sit on your two sitting bones and tailbone. Exhale and bend your knees together, then lift your feet off the floor. If you are able to balance well, straighten your knee gradually. Stretch your arms alongside the legs, parallel to each other and the floor. Try to keep the lower belly flat as this will help you balance better. Gradually come back to the starting position, and repeat the process.</p>

    <p>3.Dhanurasana (Bow Pose): Lie on your stomach with your feet wide apart and your arms by the side of your body. Fold your knees, take your hands backward and hold your ankles. Breathing in, lift your chest off the ground and pull your legs up and back. Look straight up. Keep the pose stable whilst paying attention to your breathing. Your body is now in a bow pose. Take long deep breaths as you continue to stay in the position. Come back slowly to the position. Repeat once you feel relaxed.</p>
